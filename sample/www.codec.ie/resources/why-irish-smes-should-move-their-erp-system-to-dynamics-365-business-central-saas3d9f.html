          <span><p>When it comes to businesses, the “new normal”&nbsp;means digital transformation and the&nbsp;increased&nbsp;use of technology to&nbsp;help&nbsp;them&nbsp;achieve more. Despite&nbsp;the difficult operating environment faced&nbsp;by many companies&nbsp;currently, the potential for technology to help has never been greater.</p>

<p>In the months ahead, how an organisation manages its business processes and the decisions it makes&nbsp;will be crucial in determining if that organisation&nbsp;will be successful in the future.</p>
<p>Microsoft Dynamics 365 can help businesses meet today’s challenges by bringing their customers and businesses together with the next generation of Customer Relationship (CRM) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) application.</p>
<p>Dynamics&nbsp;365&nbsp;Business Central SaaS&nbsp;connects people and processes like&nbsp;never before.&nbsp;Customers use Dynamics 365 Business Central to improve predictability, manage costs, optimise business processes, enhance customer interaction and ultimately make better business decisions.</p>
<p>Based&nbsp;on the Microsoft Azure platform,&nbsp;Dynamics 365&nbsp;Business Central SaaS is highly adaptable and rich with features, transforming how companies manage their business processes, including finance, manufacturing, sales, logistics, project management, services, and more.</p>
<h4>A management support system that can be adapted to fit the scale of your businesses&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>For organisations using legacy on-premise ERP, a move to a modern cloud-based ERP typically means a lower total cost of ownership over time.</p>
<p>Since its launch in April 2018,&nbsp;Dynamics 365&nbsp;Business Central SaaS has seen increasing adoption by organisations looking to digitally transform their businesses. The solution now has over 6,000 customers globally and is experiencing 250+% user growth year–on–year.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Source: Microsoft)</p>
<p>It&nbsp;is a cost-effective solution that enables small businesses to benefit from the use of advanced analytical solutions, AI, or the Internet of Things within one management support system. Thanks to the flexibility provided by the cloud, the solution can be adapted to fit the scale of a business as it continues to develop and grow.</p>
<p>Historically, this type of comprehensive ERP solution was only really an option for larger SME companies mainly due to the high cost of purchasing and maintaining the on-premise hardware required to run the system, alongside periodic system upgrade cost.</p>
<p>As Dynamics 365 Business Central is cloud-based, the barrier to entry is now much lower for small and medium businesses.</p>
<p>Irish SMEs will now be able to&nbsp;avail of one ‘off the shelf’ cloud solution that has the capability to run their entire business and the flexibility to scale to meet the needs of the business as it grows.</p>
