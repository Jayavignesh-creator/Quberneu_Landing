          <span><p><span><br>Did you know that by 2025, global data creation is expected to reach 175 zettabytes? That is the equivalent of 35 trillion HD movies. With this explosion of data growth, safeguarding sensitive information has never been more critical. Businesses operate in an environment where sensitive data is shared every day, sometimes unknowingly, which poses a heightened security threat to them.<br><br>With the constant evolution of AI technology, traditional security boundaries quickly become obsolete and cyber threats adjust to new circumstances. This means that companies need to have a strong data-protection strategy in place. In this blog, we explore how Microsoft Purview can help prevent data loss, ensure compliance, and manage the challenges of AI-driven data security.</span></p>

<p><span>Safeguarding your data with Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention</span><br>Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (Purview DLP) offers a centralised approach to safeguarding sensitive information across endpoints, applications and cloud platforms. With the proliferation of data sources and the growing adoption of AI technologies, protecting confidential information must become a priority. Purview DLP is embedded within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem, enabling seamless integration with applications like Teams, SharePoint and Outlook. It offers advanced functionalities like adaptive protection, which dynamically adjusts controls based on user risk levels.</p>
<p><br>This solution supports multi-faceted data protection, covering scenarios from blocking unauthorised sharing of labelled documents to monitoring file transfers to non-sanctioned applications. Purview DLP automatically classifies and labels sensitive data, applying adaptive controls to mitigate accidental or deliberate leaks. With these capabilities, organisations can stay ahead of compliance demands while maintaining operational efficiency. But technology alone is not enough. To maximise the effectiveness of Purview DLP, it is important that companies adopt specific strategies to reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorised access.</p>
<p><span><span>Effective strategies to prevent data loss</span></span></p>
<p><span><br>Preventing data leaks requires a combination of technology, policy and user education. First, implementing information protection policies that classify and label data based on sensitivity is crucial. These labels guide the enforcement of DLP policies that restrict unauthorised sharing or external transfers. Moreover, adaptive protection adds a dynamic layer by adjusting restrictions according to user behaviour and risk levels.</span></p>
<p><span><br>Employee training is equally important, ensuring users understand proper data handling and oversharing risks. Simultaneously, IT administrators can make use of endpoint DLP to control data copying, sharing and uploading to non-approved platforms.</span></p>
<p><span><br>Lastly, organisations should regularly review and update their security configurations to account for evolving threats and compliance standards. As these practices lay a solid foundation, the real-world application of Purview DLP demonstrates its effectiveness in achieving security and compliance goals.<br></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Managing data security, AI and compliance </strong></p>
<p>Purview DLP has been instrumental in addressing a variety of challenges, from safeguarding confidential files to controlling the use of sensitive information with AI tools. This is where Microsoft's Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) framework comes into its own.</p>
<p>DSPM for AI provides comprehensive insights into AI-related data activities, ensuring sensitive information remains protected. It offers detailed analytics on data interactions, including user prompts and exfiltration attempts, enabling proactive risk mitigation. DSPM integrates seamlessly with Purview DLP by uniting information protection policies, adaptive data loss prevention (which adjusts controls based on risk levels) and endpoint controls.</p>
<p>By using browser extensions and auto-labelling, it enforces compliance across AI environments, safeguarding critical assets against leaks. With pre-built policies and weekly insights into sensitive data exposure, DSPM helps align the use of AI with security standards.</p>
<p>Purview DLP protects sensitive data across three critical business scenarios. Firstly, it automatically guards against internal mishandling, such as when confidential files are mistakenly shared in general Teams channels. Secondly, it prevents data leakage to external services, blocking sensitive information from being shared with AI tools and enforcing stricter controls for high-risk users. Lastly, during complex scenarios like mergers, its sensitivity labelling ensures proper document handling across integrating systems.</p>
<p>This comprehensive protection not only prevents costly data breaches but also simplifies GDPR compliance and helps maintain visibility over sensitive data activities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Protect your business’ most vulnerable asset</strong></p>
<p>As the global datasphere continues to expand and with the <a href="https://www.embroker.com/blog/cost-of-a-data-breach/">average cost of a data breach standing at €4.74m</a>, organisations that wish to maintain their data safety can no longer afford to stay inactive. Microsoft Purview DLP is the comprehensive, one-stop security toolkit needed to safeguard sensitive information across your business’ digital ecosystem.</p>
