          <span><p><span>If you are using Microsoft Dynamics GP (Great Plains) as your enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, now is the time to consider upgrading to a more modern and cloud-based solution in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Dynamics GP has been a reliable and robust system that has been serving many businesses for decades, but Microsoft took steps to deprecate the solution with mainstream support ending for all versions back in January 2023. Many businesses have been left considering what their options are for their next ERP solution; the answer should be Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Whilst it may seem like a daunting task to undertake the move to Business Central, the benefits will far outweigh the challenges.&nbsp; As well as the many benefits of a move to the cloud, there are tools and accelerators available which will significantly speed up your migration.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is Dynamics 365 Business Central?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dynamics 365 Business Central (formerly NAV) is a cloud-based ERP solution that helps you manage your finances, operations, sales, and customer service from anywhere and on any device. It is part of the wider Dynamics 365 suite of business applications that integrate seamlessly with each other and with other Microsoft products, such as Office 365, Power BI, and Azure.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dynamics 365 Business Central is designed to be easy to use, is customisable, and extensible, and offers a rich set of features and functionalities that can help streamline your processes, optimise resources, and ultimately grow your business.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Dynamics 365 Business Central is the natural successor to Dynamics GP.&nbsp; One of the reasons for ending support for the solution was the overlap of the two products, with Business Central being a more feature-rich solution in comparison to GP.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What are the benefits of migrating from Dynamics GP to Dynamics 365 Business Central?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some of the most compelling reasons why you should consider migrating from Dynamics GP to Dynamics 365 Business Central:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Cloud-based:</span></strong><span> Dynamics 365 Business Central is a cloud-based solution that does not require any hardware or software installation, maintenance, or upgrades. You can access it from anywhere and on any device, and you can benefit from the security, scalability, and reliability of the Microsoft cloud. You can also save on the costs and hassle of managing your own servers, backups, and licenses. Microsoft release two annual upgrades which you receive automatically – no expensive future upgrades or end-of-life solutions!!!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Modern and user-friendly:</span></strong><span> Dynamics 365 Business Central has a modern and user-friendly interface that is consistent with other Microsoft products and applications. It is easy to navigate, search, and personalise, and it offers a familiar and intuitive user experience. With the introduction of Microsoft Copilot, AI is now embedded in Business Central -&nbsp; allowing you the ability to perform a multitude of tasks&nbsp; such as bank reconciliations , predicting late payments and cashflow forecasting. In addition, users can ask natural language questions such as “How do I create a credit memo” and receive immediate assistance using Copilot.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Integrated and connected:</span></strong><span> Dynamics 365 Business Central is integrated and connected with other Dynamics 365 applications, such as Dynamics 365 Sales &amp; Dynamics 365 Field Service, as well as with other Microsoft products, such as Office 365, Power BI, and Azure. Users can export Business Central data to Excel for further interrogation, get customer insights in Outlook when responding to customers based on Business Central data, and collaborate with colleagues on Business Central activities in Microsoft Teams. This means that you can have a unified and comprehensive view of your business data and processes, and you can share and collaborate with your team and customers more easily and effectively.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Extensible via Third-Party Applications:</span></strong><span> You can also connect Business Central with hundreds of Microsoft approved third-party applications and services through the Microsoft AppSource marketplace. This allows you to extend and enhance Business Central without development.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong><span>Flexible, scalable, and secure:</span></strong><span> As a Software as a Service (SaaS) solution, Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central is both flexible and scalable. Organisations only pay for the licences they require, with multiple licensing options to suit the needs of individuals. Business Central is hosted on Microsoft Azure, which comes with the associated benefits of being a scalable solution which can handle high volumes without latency, and the wrapper of Microsoft security to ensure your data always remains safe. Redundancy and failovers are in place as standard to ensure your users don’t feel the pain of downtimes.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
